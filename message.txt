Added BaseX to .gitignore

This is something that I am trying to work on for the 
database. This is a pretty interesting thing that could be 
helpful if I can figure out how to use it properly. This 
will be restricted to the schema branch for the time being 
as it involves the xml files.

I also added message.txt to the .gitignore file so I can add 
longer messages to my commits.
