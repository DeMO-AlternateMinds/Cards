1. Do not delete commit history
   - We cannot recover the changes made if the commit history is deleted
   - We cannot attribute work done by specific group members 
2. Do not make changes directly to master branch
   - You should first make a seperate branch then make a merge request 
3. Do not make branch protections without notifying the members 24 hours in advance
4. Do not mess with a personal/test branch
