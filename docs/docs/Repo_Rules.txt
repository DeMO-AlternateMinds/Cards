Git Guidelines

1. Do not delete commit history
   - We cannot recover the changes made if the commit history is deleted
   - We cannot attribute work done by specific group members 
2. Do not make changes directly to master branch
   - You should first make a seperate branch then make a merge request 
3. Do not make branch protections without notifying the members 24 hours in advance
4. Do not mess with a personal/test branches

BANNED COMMANDS:
The following commands can destory our project if used; so don't use them.

- git push -d origin branch 

This will delete a branch remotely. I haven't added any protections yet to the
branches so just don't use it.

- git reset --hard && git push -f

This will delete the commit history and will (forcibly) push this change.


- git add ./.../git push -f origin master
- git push origin +master
-git rebase -| |- / git push
